JDBC connection:

// Add JDBC dependency in gradle
implementation 'org.mariadb.jdbc:mariadb-java-client:3.0.0'

// Sample JDBC logic
Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mariadb://localhost:3306/game", "user", "password");
PreparedStatement stmt = conn.prepareStatement("INSERT INTO scores (username, score) VALUES (?, ?)");
stmt.setString(1, "Student");
stmt.setInt(2, score);
stmt.executeUpdate();
